AIR File Browser
======================

A file browsing library for Adobe AIR / ActionScript 3. The library includes typical features for navigating a file 
structure, including forward/backward history, file sorting, filtering by extension, and search functionality. 

The core of the library, `FileBrowser.as`, is a logic-only class using only native AIR functionality, and can be used
in any AIR, Flex, or Starling application - just add your own UI.

Also included is an example project that demonstrates the library in use in Feathers. Feel free to use this in your own
Feathers applications.
